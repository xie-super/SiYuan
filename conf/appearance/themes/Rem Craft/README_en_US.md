## Instructions for Use

### Up to Date

1. Deleted the calendar function that comes with the theme, and adapted the style of the [calendar plugin](https://github.com/svchord/siyuan-arco-calendar).

### Other

1. `Noto Sans SC` font files are no longer included in v2.5.2 and later versions, please go to the [official website](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+SC) to download if you need it.

2. `script/config.js` can set whether the special function of the theme is enabled or not, it is enabled by default, modify the value to `false` and restart the software to close.

3. The area of the top bar except the button can drag the window.

4. In extreme cases, the tab bar may be covered by the top bar button, restarting the software can solve the problem.

5. The close buttons of large pop-up windows such as settings and search are hidden, click the surrounding blank space to close.

## Reference Style

Here are the main styling sources:

- Referring to the design of Windows 11, the styles of sidebars, sliders, switches, and input boxes have been modified
